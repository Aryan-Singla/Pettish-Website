## Description of Idea
#### Idea : To Build an unqiue online pet shop which have pets buying options, their food and their toys buying options along with their tutorial links and description so that anyone can buy a pet for him/her without having any type hesitation of buying products online.
#### Problem : Most of people loves to have a pet but buying pets with less knowledge about them is a very difficult task. After somehow buying the pet, the problem arrises that what, when and how to feed them and which toys for them should buy so that they can also release some stress and live life freely.
- As a store can have a certain number of pets, customers don’t have many choices, due to paucity of time, they come under pressure, and they buy them even if they do not want to.​

- Due to less knowledge about the pet, customers are not able to take any proper justice and the shopkeeper gives them the pet of the desired breed, for which they have to suffer later.​

- Due to lack of stores nearby, they have to buy pets at the price quoted by the shopkeeper, due to which there is a deep impact on the pockets of the customers.​

- Due to lack of experience, the customer does not know when to feed the pet and what to feed. Whatever pet food the shopkeeper gives, they have to feed it whether it is beneficial for the pet or not.​

- They do not know how to take care of their pet in future, due to this lack of guidance they have to face problems going forward.​

The aim of this project is to get the customers to do shopping from a place without wasting their valuable time where they get all the facilities that a customer wants to make their life run smoother. 

- Customers can buy a pet easily by going through categories like, type of animal you are looking for, then going through the breeds of that animal. Now this breed selection category consists of a brief introduction of that particular breed having a link to a YouTube video also, so that customers can understand properly about the breeds of that particular animal so that cannot regret to his/her decision in future. ​

- After selection of the breed, customers can buy a pet or add them to their Wishlist as per their convenience. ​

- There will be a doorstep service for your chosen pets, saving you lots of time.​

- As there are various varieties in the store, they can easily compare the prices suiting the budget of the customer and also, they have many choices of pets so they can choose very wisely.​

- The website and app contain a “Product” section where you can buy some pet’s daily life stuff like beds, kennel, towels, brushes, nail cutters, combs, shampoos and conditioners, collars, apparels and several more.​

- There will be a food and medicine section where you can find not only the best quality food materials for your pet but also get to know about what type of meal will be good for your pet. Several food categories like kibble/dry, cannel, semi-moist, home cooked and raw will be there along with its explanation.
